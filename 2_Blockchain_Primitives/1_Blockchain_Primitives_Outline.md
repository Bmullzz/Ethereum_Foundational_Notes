### Lesson 2.1 - Cryptographic Hash Functions
- A <u>Hash Function</u> is a function that is used to map input data of any size to output data of a fixed size.
- The output is called a hash
- The process is called hashing
- The same input should should always make the same output
- Slightly similar inputs should have very different outputs

- Cryptographic hash function properties:
	- 1. Deterministic
	- 2. Fast
	- 3. Infeasible to reverse
		- One way
	- 4. Small change in input results in a very different output
		- Apparent randomness
	- 5. Collision Resistent 

- Applications of Hash Functions
	- 1. Verify data integrity 
		- Checksums
		- Password hashing
	- 2. Proof of Work
		- Hard to find a given hash
		- Easy to verify work has been done
		- Reduce Spam
	- 3. Data Identification 
		- Hash Tables
		- P2P networks
		- Pseudorandom number generation

### Lesson 2.2 - Public Key Cryptography
- Generating Key Pairs
	- Generated by entering random data into a key generation algorithm

- Public Key Cryptography
	- Public Key cryptography provides 2 factors:
		- 1. Encryption
			- Only private key holder can decrypt a message encrypted with the corresponding public key
		- 2. Authentification
			- A public key can verify ownership of a private key
			- Digital Signatures
				- Signed transactions on the blockchain

- Public Key Encryption
	- Send a secret message to someone, verify that only they can read it
		- 1. Sender encrypts message with recipients public key
		- 2. Transmit encrypted Message
		- 3. Recipient Decrypts message

- Digital Signatures
	- A system to ensure that data has been signed by an individual


### Lesson 2.3 - Merkle Trees
- What is a Merkle tree?
	- 1. Tree data structure
		- Based on a set of data
		- Leaves are hashes of data
		- Nodes are hashes of its children
	- 2. Features
		- Cryptographically authenticated
			- Changing one piece of data changes the root
		- Efficiently verify contracts
			- Concisely prove that data is a set
			- Requires a limited subset of a tree
			- Scalability
		- Does not reveal contents of the set
	- A binary Radix tree
		- Features:
			- Store key/value pairs
			- Searchable
			- Efficient insertions and deletions
			- Map large data sets

### Lesson 2.4 - Blockchain Structure
- Blockchains 
	- Main goal is to maintain a state that everyone agrees on.
	- Features:
		- Maintain state in a peer to peer network
		- Manage state updates
			- All participants agree that updates are valid
			- Consensus on a new system state
- Updates are broken into sets (blocks)
	- Summarized with Merkle tree root
- A simple block example
	- A block includes:
		- A list of transactions
			- And a Merkle tree based list
		- A Hash of the previous block
		- A Nonce
			- Used in Proof of Work
			- Modified to get a valid block hash
		- Consensus on the new system state
- Once constructed, a valid block is broadcast to the network
- Work begins on the next block
- Created blocks are immutable
- Block hash is included in the next block

- Chain of blocks

### 2.5 - Smart Contracts
- "A computer protocol to digitally execute terms of a contract"
- Desirable traits of a smart contract
	- 1. Trustless
		- No 3rd parties or intermediaries
		- Universally accessable
	- 2. Truckable
		- Transactions can be traced 
		- Auditability
	- 3. Irreversible
		- Transactions are final
		- Security is paramount
	- 4. Self-executing
		- Reduce Costs
		- Increase Speed
		- Use case Variability

- Smart Contracts do not necessarily have to be on a blockchain, but blockchains offer:
	- A trustless, universally accessible system
	- Trackable, irreversible transactions
	- Mechanisms for self-execution

- Smart Contract
	- Noun
	- 1. Code that is stored on the Blockchain and self-executes using the trust and security of the blockchain network.
	- 2. Application logic that runs in a distributed fashion on the Ethereum blockchain and operates using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).


### 2.5.1 - Smart Contracts
- History
	- Years before Satoshi Nakamoto introduced the idea of the Blockchain, a well respected Computer Science Researcher and cryptographer, named Nick Szabo, introduced the concept of a Smart Contract.
	- In 1996, he wrote a research paper on the concept.
	- He defined Smart Contracts as "a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises".

- Enter Ethereum
	- Building on the inventions of Szabo and Nakamoto, Vitalik Buterin released the Ethereum White paper
	- It was titled "A Next-Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform".
	- The paper discussed the implementation of a blockchain protocol with a Turing-complete programming language that would allow for the creation of "complex applications involving having digital assets being directly controlled by a piece of code implementing arbitrary rules."
	- Buterin defines Smart Contracts as "Cryptographic 'boxes' that contain value that can only be unlocked if certain conditions are met".


### 2.6 - Nodes
- Traditional Internet Architecture is server based
	- Has single points of failure

- Peer to Peer Networks
	- Nodes participate by running the appropriate software
	- They could be a blockchain or other file sharing network
		- Bitcoin
		- Ethereum
		- BitTorrent
	- ADD SCREEN SHOT
	- A Web-3 capable browser connects via an RPC to an Ethereum Node (gateway).
	- The Ethereum Node connects to the Ethereum Network via a P2P connection

- Nodes can participate in 3 ways
	- Run a light client
		- A shallow copy of the blockchain
	- Full node
		- Full copy of the blockchain
	- Mining
		- A full node and verify transactions



### 2.7 - Blockchain Forks
- What is a fork? 
	- A blockchain split
		- Intentional or unintentional
		- Caused by network changes
		- Community disagreement
		- Hard fork
		- Soft fork
- Hard Fork
	- The new chain is incompatible with the old chain
	- The two chains never meet again
	- Used if a clear consensus is established around a change
	- If a clear winner chain isn't established, the economics, and politics can ruin the project
- Soft Fork
	- The change is backward compatible with the original state of software before the fork
		- Both rule sets exist in the same chain 
		- If 51% of a network adopts the new rules, old rules will no longer be accepted
	- Mostly used for smaller network changes
- Unintentional Forks
	- Blockchain split
	- Unintentional
	- Proof of work
	- Minors simultaneously discover a block
	- 6 transaction verifications make it virtually 100% that your transaction is in the longest chain
