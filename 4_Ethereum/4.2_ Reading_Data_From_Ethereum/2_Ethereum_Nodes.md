# Ethereum Nodes

Ethereum nodes are what maintain the integrity and data on the network. There are several different [types of Ethereum nodes](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/full-vs-light-vs-archive-nodes) that are participating in the network and are used depending on what type of data is needed.

**Full nodes** store and validate all blocks and transactions over the entire blockchain locally. When a smart contract transaction is executed, Ethereum full nodes execute all of the instructions in the smart contract. Together, full nodes determine whether the smart contract execution is producing the desired result. However, [running full Ethereum nodes](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/running-your-own-node) is expensive to and can consume a great deal of energy.

Luckily, Alchemy provides access to all archive data (from block 0) and latest data (from the most recent and pending blocks) completely for free.
